This is a React Native application built with Expo. Here's a summary of my findings:

**Project Overview:**

*   **Name:** `daily-quotes`
*   **Framework:** React Native with Expo
*   **Purpose:** Displays daily or random quotes to the user.
*   **Platform:** iOS, Android, and Web.

**Key Features:**

*   **Quote Display:** The app displays a quote and its author in a styled container.
*   **Random Quotes:** Users can refresh to get a new random quote.
*   **Daily Quotes:** The app has a feature to show a "quote of the day" based on the current date.
*   **Light/Dark Mode:** The app supports light and dark themes, and users can toggle between them.
*   **Custom Fonts:** The app uses the "PlayfairDisplay-Regular" font for a more elegant look.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Routing:** `expo-router` is used for file-based routing.
*   **State Management:** React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) are used for managing component state.
*   **UI Components:** The app uses standard React Native components, with custom styling.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   `expo`: Core Expo library.
    *   `react-native`: Core React Native library.
    *   `expo-router`: For routing.
    *   `expo-font`: For loading custom fonts.
    *   `@expo/vector-icons`: For icons.
*   **Linting:** ESLint is set up for code quality.
*   **Build & Deployment:** EAS (Expo Application Services) is configured for building and submitting the app.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **No tests:** There are no tests in the project. Adding unit and component tests would improve the code quality and prevent regressions.
*   **No state management library:** For a small application like this, React hooks are sufficient. However, as the application grows, a state management library like Redux or Zustand might be beneficial for managing global state.
*   **No analytics:** No analytics are configured to track user engagement.
*   **No error reporting:** No error reporting service is configured to track crashes and errors.
